    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-container">
      <p class="journey-origins">👋 <strong>Origins:</strong> Hi! I'm Hieu, but you can call me Calvin. I grew up with a curiosity for patterns and problem-solving, which naturally led me to the world of data science. My journey began with simple statistical analyses and gradually evolved into a passion for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets.</p>
      
      <p class="journey-academic">🏫 <strong>Academic:</strong> I'm now a senior at UC Davis, working towards a Bachelor's in Statistical Data Science with a Minor in Technology Management. Throughout my studies, I've developed a strong foundation in statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques, particularly enjoying hands-on projects where I used Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas.</p>
      
      <p class="journey-impact">🚩 <strong>Impact:</strong> I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive real-world solutions, especially in fields like healthcare and technology. My work at ASUCD Pantry has shown me how predictive analytics can directly impact resource allocation and reduce waste, while my research with JFF has helped young professionals navigate career paths through data-driven insights.</p>
      
      <p class="journey-beyond">🔭 <strong>Beyond:</strong> Looking forward, I aim to continue bridging the gap between technical analyses and practical applications. I believe the true power of data science lies not just in building models, but in making complex findings accessible and actionable for everyone. I'm excited to contribute to projects that transform data into decisions that make a difference.</p>

            I developed MealBuddy, a cross-platform mobile app that streamlines fridge management and meal planning. Built with React Native and Expo, the app helps users track ingredients in real time and receive AI-generated meal recommendations based on inventory and dietary goals. MealBuddy leverages Firebase for user authentication and Firestore for live data storage, ensuring a seamless experience. Its integrated chatbot uses the Google Gemini API to provide personalized recipe suggestions, while the interactive dashboard visualizes nutrition goals and progress.
