    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-container">
      <p class="journey-origins">👋 <strong>Origins:</strong> Hi! I'm Hieu, but you can call me Calvin. I grew up with a curiosity for patterns and problem-solving, which naturally led me to the world of data science. My journey began with simple statistical analyses and gradually evolved into a passion for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets.</p>
      
      <p class="journey-academic">🎓 <strong>Academic:</strong> I recently graduated from UC Davis with a Bachelor's in Statistical Data Science and a Minor in Technology Management. Throughout my studies, I developed a strong foundation in statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques, particularly enjoying hands-on projects where I used Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. My time at university wrapped up with me leading some really exciting AI projects that achieved great accuracy rates and made a real impact.</p>
      
      <p class="journey-impact">🚩 <strong>Impact:</strong> I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive real-world solutions, especially in fields like healthcare and technology. My work at ASUCD Pantry has shown me how predictive analytics can directly impact resource allocation and reduce waste, while my research with JFF has helped young professionals navigate career paths through data-driven insights. Each project I undertake is driven by the desire to make technology more accessible and beneficial for everyone.</p>
      
      <p class="journey-beyond">🔭 <strong>Beyond Work:</strong> When I'm not diving into datasets or building AI models, you'll find me exploring the great outdoors through hiking and keeping up with the latest AI news and breakthroughs, where I love analyzing how new developments might shape the future. I'm a big tech enthusiast who loves experimenting with new frameworks and staying current with emerging technologies. I also enjoy mentoring fellow students and contributing to open-source projects, believing that knowledge grows when shared. Looking forward, I aim to continue bridging the gap between technical innovation and practical applications that make a meaningful difference in people's lives.</p>

          <h3>SHIPSmart</h3>
          <span class="project-timeline">Apr 2025</span>
          <p class="project-description">I co-developed SHIPSmart, an AI-powered iOS app built at HackDavis 2025 to help UC SHIP students estimate healthcare costs upfront and avoid surprise medical bills. The app uses AI, Cerebras API, and a custom database to manage insurance claims, automate reimbursements, and ensure users always get the lowest price. If our estimate is lower than the bill, SHIPSmart handles claims and fights for rebates, eliminating paperwork and phone calls for students.</p>
